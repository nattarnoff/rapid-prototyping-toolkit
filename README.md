# Rapid Prototyping Toolkit

I got bored starting from scratch every time I built something new, so I compiled this prototyping toolkit. Its based on Bermon Painter's Middleman toolkit, with a few adjustments of my own based on the way I do things. 

It uses Middleman, Slim, and Sass, so make sure you have those running.
